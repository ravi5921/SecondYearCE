Write a simple program that convert the temperature in degree Celsius to degree Fahrenheit and vice versa using the basic concept of class and object. Make separate class for Centigrade and Fahrenheit which will have the private member to hold the temperature value and make conversion functions in each class for conversion from one to other. For example you will have function toFahrenheit() in class Celsius that converts to Fahrenheit scale and returns the value.
Assume that you want to check whether the number is prime or not. Write a program that asks for a number repeatedly. When it finishes the calculation the program asks if the user wants to do another calculation. The response can be 'y' or 'n'. Don't forget to use the object class concept.
Create a class called carpark that has int data member for car id, int data member for charge/hour and float data member for time. Set the data and show the charges and parked hours of corresponding car id. Make two member functions for setting and showing the data. Member function should be called from other functions.
Write a program with classes to represent circle, rectangle and triangle. Each classes should have data members to represent the actual objects and member functions to read and display objects, find perimeter and area of the objects and other useful functions. Use the classes to create objects in your program.
Assume that an object represents an employee report that contains the information like employee id, total bonus, total overtime in a particular year. Use array of objects to represent n employees' reports. Write a program that displays report. Use setpara() member function to set report attributes by passing the arguments and member function displayreport() to show the reports according to parameter passed. Display the report in following format.
Employee with ... ... ... has received Rs ... ... ...as bonus
and
had worked ... ... ... hours as a over time in  year ... ... ...
